## Link's Quest Tracker

This was made as a final project for our mod on React-Redux. It is the classic Redux to-do app, but with my own twist put on it.

[Links Quest Tracker backend](https://github.com/DavidWolff218/Links_Quest_Tracker_backend)

### Usage

- On the login you will be instructed to login. Sorry, the only name that it will accept is "Link".
- From the homepage you can see how many quests are avaiable in each area, and then select an area to see the specific quests.
- On an areas quest page you can also edit or delete specific quests.
- From the "Add a Quest" page you can select which area you want to add a quest to.
